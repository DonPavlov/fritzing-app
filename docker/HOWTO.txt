# HOWTO work with fritzing docker containers.
# Docker containers are used for Fritzing's official linux builds.
# It'd be good to have Windows and MacOS containers too, but that's not achieved yet.

# Improving the docker configuration

## To improve and test locally.

copy Dockerfile.fedora Dockerfile
docker build --tag fritzing/build:fedora-31 .

## To publish it
# Note: These tags are used by the CI/CD build system,
# and will be effective immediately.
# For testing purposes, use your own docker namespace.
# If you would like to improve the official Fritzing docker
# build containers, please ask Kjell or Ovidiu-Florin
#

docker push fritzing/build:fedora-31



# Using docker for local builds

release-linux.sh

To create release (or debug) versions, use the script release-linux.sh < platform > < release name>.

If the releasename includes the magic keyword "debug", debug information will be added to
the binary, and the "develop" branch of fritzing-parts will be used for the parts database.
For examples, see the file travis.yml.

xvfb-release-helper.sh

This script is not thought to be called directly. It is required to enable automated
CLI calls to Fritzing on headless systems (without GUI.


build-linux.sh

Just do a quick build. This script is not an essential part of the toolchain.
